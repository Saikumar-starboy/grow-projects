<h1><u> Dr.Reddy Foundation: </u><h1>
<h3>Inroduction:<h3>
<pre > He journey that impacted over 2 million lives started in 1996
 when Dr. K. Anji Reddy, a renowned scientist, entrepreneur and
 philanthropist, encouraged by the possibilities of helping others
 to share and reap the benefits of India’s economic growth, started 
Dr.Reddy’s Foundation. The foundation was established with a mission 
of assisting disadvantaged people to have access to quality education
 and develop skills to keep pace with modern day challenges. After 25
 years, the mission has only grown to encompass some of the most 
complex social problems of the day but with the same enthusiasm to 
change lives.
